                    Hi! My name is Sylwia and I can call myself the luckiest person in the world because I have always known what I would like to do in my life. As a little girl I used to pretend to be a teacher and here I am now - my dream came true. As for today, I am a Maths teacher with over 10 years’ experience in tutoring.</br>
                    My adventure with teaching started when I was a high-school student. The choice of University and the degree course was pretty obvious then. I am a Bachelor with specialty in Mathematics and Education of children with intellectual disability and a Master of Mathematics. In my spare time I focus on self – development to improve more soft skills, as they enhance the quality of teaching tremendously.</br>
                    I tend to compare Math skills to child development: they need to start crawling, then take the first steps to finally learn how to run. It is the same with Maths. You cannot run if you do not learn how to walk first. 
                    If you feel like you have missed some steps on the way, you are struggling with certain subjects or you just want to improve your skills, do not hesitate to get in touch with me!</br>

                    In terms of my academic studies, training and development, I have acquired the QTS. </br>
                    As a Maths Tutor both in the UK and Poland, my duty over the years has focused on creating interesting lessons that reflect Maths concepts, learning objectives and subject matter. Moreover I have worked on preparing both attractive teaching aids, and tests.</br>
                    As a friendly, honest and hardworking person with high levels of concentration, my proactive</br>
                    approach to tutoring has been very well received. In order to support learning and stimulate student engagement, I have participated in a range of Maths classes. They taught me how to develop unique learning methods that can refer to student’s hobby for instance or any other circumstances in order to help and ease the learning process.</br>
                    </br>
                    I am currently focused on 11+ and GCSC but the range of topics I can cover is way wider. Ask me what do you need and most likely I will be able to help you.</br>
                    I provide all necessary educational materials, tests and homework for each lesson.</br>
                    </br>
                    Due to recent circumstances regarding the coronavirus outbreak, I'm taking the leap and fully transitioning to online tuition only.</br>

            <div style="">What is Lorem Ipsum?</br>
                </br>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</br>
                Why do we use it?</br>
                </br>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</br>
                </br>
                Where does it come from?</br>
                </br>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</br>
                </br>
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</br>
                Where can I get some?</br>
                </br>
                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
